### Example Conversations

**Question & Answer**:

```
👤 User: @Brief Why did Bitcoin drop from #2 to #3 today?

🤖 Brief AI:
"Great question! Bitcoin moved from #2 to #3 because:

1. **Government Impact Score Dropped** (85 → 72): The SEC delayed
   the ETF decision by 2 weeks. This removes the immediate catalyst.

2. **a2 Milk's Local Advantage Increased**: They announced 15 new
   jobs in Auckland, boosting their location score from 85 → 95.

3. **Technical Setup Weakened Slightly**: BTC failed to hold
   $42,500 resistance, dropping to $41,800. This lowered the
   technical score from 78 → 73.

Bitcoin is still a strong opportunity (#3 is excellent!), but the
ranking shifted based on these factors. The fundamentals remain
bullish long-term. 📊"

⬆️ 34  💬 7  🔖 Save
```

**Risk Assessment**:

```
👤 User: @Brief I want to put my entire $5K into Bitcoin. Thoughts?

🤖 Brief AI:
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to give you some careful
guidance here:

⚠️ **Concern: Portfolio Concentration Risk**

Putting 100% of capital into one asset, especially a volatile one
like Bitcoin (30-day volatility: 45%), is extremely risky.

**My Recommendation:**
- Max 20-25% in Bitcoin ($1,000-1,250)
- Diversify the remaining $3,750 across:
  - 30% NZ stocks (a2 Milk, F&P Healthcare)
  - 25% International stocks (lower risk)
  - 20% Forex/stable plays
  - 5% Keep as cash reserve

**Why?**
If Bitcoin drops 30% (not uncommon), you'd lose $1,500 with my plan
vs. $1,500 with your plan. But if ALL your other picks gain 10%,
you're still up overall.

Remember: Diversification is your friend. 🛡️

Would you like me to suggest a balanced portfolio?"

⬆️ 67  💬 12  🔖 Save
```

**Educational Explanation**:

```
👤 User: @Brief What does "RSI: 68" mean? Keep seeing this.

🤖 Brief AI:
"Happy to explain! 🎓

**RSI = Relative Strength Index**

It's a momentum indicator that measures if an asset is:
- Overbought (too expensive, might drop soon)
- Oversold (too cheap, might rise soon)

**The Scale:**
- 0-30: Oversold (potential buy signal) 🟢
- 30-70: Neutral zone (healthy) 🟡
- 70-100: Overbought (potential sell signal) 🔴

**For Bitcoin at RSI: 68**
This means it's approaching overbought territory but not quite
there. It's bullish momentum, but not excessive. Good sign!

**Example:** If RSI hits 85, it's screaming "I'm too hot! I might
need to cool off (price drop)."

Think of it like a pressure gauge. 68 is high pressure but not
dangerous yet. 💡

Make sense?"
