## Slide 2: The Problem

### **95% of Investors Are Flying Blind**

**The Reality**:

- 📰 Retail investors rely on **24-hour-old news** (too late)
- 📊 Bloomberg Terminal costs **$24,000/year** (unaffordable)
- 🤷 No one knows about **local opportunities** in their backyard
- ⏰ Information arrives **after** institutional investors have already moved
- 🔍 Alternative data (satellite imagery, foot traffic) is **$50K+/month** (institutions only)

**The Result**:

- Retail investors consistently **underperform** the market by 3-5% annually
- "Picking stocks is gambling" becomes self-fulfilling prophecy
- Institutions win because they have **information advantage**

---

### The Current Landscape Is Broken

| Who              | What They Get                     | Cost             | Result         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Institutions** | Real-time data + alternative data | $50K-500K/month  | +15-25% annual |
| **Retail**       | Delayed news + basic charts       | Free-$300/year   | -3-5% annual   |
| **Gap**          | **Information asymmetry = $12T**  | **Inaccessible** | **Unfair**     |

**The Opportunity**: Close this gap. Democratize the data.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### **Brief = Bloomberg Terminal, Reimagined for 2026**

**What We Do**:
Every morning at 6 AM, Brief delivers a **personalized 3-minute AI briefing** covering:

1. 🎯 **Local Opportunities** (your city, your region)
   - Example: "Auckland port activity up 40% → Port of Tauranga stock likely +12%"
2. 🌍 **Global Observations** (worldwide markets)
   - Example: "Satellite shows Chinese oil storage at 5-year low → Crude prices rising"
3. 📊 **Portfolio Alerts** (your holdings only)
   - Example: "Tesla denied German permit at 3:47 PM → Exit before market opens at -5%"
4. 🛰️ **Alternative Data** (institutional edge)
   - Satellite imagery, foot traffic, credit card data, social sentiment
5. 🤖 **AI Strategy** (4 options: conservative, moderate, aggressive, pass)
   - Historical win rate, risk level, exact entry/exit prices

**Delivery**: Email, voice briefing (3 min), mobile app, real-time alerts

---

### How It Works (User Journey)

```
5:00 AM  →  Brief's AI wakes up, interrogates 67+ data sources
            (750-1,100 API calls: market data, news, satellite, social)

5:30 AM  →  AI analyzes your location (Auckland), your portfolio (TSLA, AAPL),
            your risk profile (moderate), and global patterns

6:00 AM  →  📧 Email + 🎧 Voice briefing lands in your inbox
            "Good morning! Here's what matters today..."

6:03 AM  →  You've consumed 5 opportunities (1 local, 4 global)
            Each with: risk level, potential %, historical accuracy, strategy

9:30 AM  →  Market opens. You act (or don't). Decision is yours.

4:00 PM  →  Portfolio alert: "TSLA denied permit. Consider exit."
            You had 17 HOURS to plan (vs competitors who learn at 9:30 AM)
```

**Result**: You now have the same information as hedge funds, 12-24 hours earlier than traditional news.

## Slide 4: Product Demo

### **Live Example: A-Grade Observation**

**NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**  
**Signal Strength**: 94/100 (A-Grade)  
**Date**: January 8, 2026

**7 Signals Converged**:

1. 🛰️ Satellite imagery: TSMC factories at 95% capacity (24/7 production)
2. 📊 Institutional buying: 37 funds added $2.4B in 15 days
3. 🧠 CEO sentiment: Jensen Huang confidence at 18-month high (9.2/10)
4. 📱 Social buzz: Twitter mentions +180%, 78% bullish
5. 🔧 Technical: Golden Cross + breakout with 3x volume
6. 🌍 Geopolitical: $50B CHIPS Act 2.0 funding (NVIDIA primary beneficiary)
7. 📰 Product launch: Blackwell chip in 3 weeks, $4.7B pre-orders

**Historical Pattern**: This 7-signal convergence has **87% accuracy**, averaged **+24% returns** in 6-8 weeks

**Strategy Options**:

- **Conservative**: Wait for launch → +8-12% (80% probability)
- **Moderate**: Staged entry now → +12-15% (70% probability)
- **Aggressive**: Full position now → +15-20% (60% probability)

**Outcome**: User decides. Brief provided the intelligence. ✅

## Slide 6: Business Model

### **3 Revenue Streams**

#### 1. Subscription Revenue (Primary)

| Tier           | Price            | Features                                  | % of Users |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Free**       | $0/month         | 24h-delayed briefing, ads                 | 30%        |
| **Standard**   | $9.99/month      | Real-time briefing, 10 opportunities      | 35%        |
| **Premium**    | $24.99/month     | All + portfolio alerts + alternative data | 28%        |
| **Pro**        | $99/month        | All + API access + advanced indicators    | 5%         |
| **Enterprise** | $499-2,999/month | Multi-user, white-label, custom           | 2%         |

**Weighted ARPU**: $18-25/month (increasing as users upgrade)

**Conversion Funnel**:

- Free → 40% convert to paid within 90 days
- Standard → 30% upgrade to Premium within 12 months
- Premium → 10% upgrade to Pro within 24 months

---

#### 2. Broker Affiliate Revenue (Secondary)

**How It Works**:

- User sees opportunity in Brief
- Brief recommends best broker for that asset (e.g., "Trade this on Hatch")
- Brief assists with KYC/onboarding (5-10 minutes)
- User funds account and trades
- Broker pays Brief $25-200 CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)

**30+ Broker Partners**:

- **NZ**: Hatch ($25), Sharesies ($20), Tiger ($30)
- **AU**: Stake ($30), Superhero ($25)
- **US**: Robinhood ($10-30), Webull, Interactive Brokers ($200)
- **Global**: eToro ($200-600), Binance ($50)

**Revenue Projections**:

- Year 1: 10K users × 60% × $50 CPA = **$300K**
- Year 3: 150K users × 75% × $75 CPA = **$13.65M**
- Year 5: 500K users × 80% × $80 CPA = **$32M**

**Plus**: Ongoing revenue share from trading volume (0.05-0.1%)

---

#### 3. Data Licensing (Future)

**Target**: Hedge funds and institutional investors

**What We Sell**:

- Brief's community sentiment data (proprietary)
- Alternative data insights (aggregated, anonymized)
- AI prediction models (accuracy metrics)

**Pricing**: $50K-200K per client per year

**Potential**: 100-500 clients = $5M-100M/year

**Timeline**: Year 3+ (need scale first)

---

### Unit Economics

**Cost to Acquire Customer (CAC)**:

- Paid marketing: $30-50 per user
- Organic/referral: $5-15 per user

- Premium: $24.99 × 36 months × 75% retention = $674
- Blended: ~$300-400

**LTV/CAC Ratio**: 12-16x (excellent, >3x is considered good)

## Slide 14: Risks & Mitigation

### **Key Risks**

#### 1. Regulatory Risk

**Risk**: Classified as financial advisor, requiring RIA licensing ($50-200K per jurisdiction)

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ "Observations not advice" language throughout
- ✅ Prominent disclaimers on every screen
- ✅ Securities attorney on retainer ($10K/month)
- ✅ Similar to Bloomberg Terminal (data platform, not advisor)
- ✅ Terms of Service: "For informational purposes only"

**Probability**: Low (15%)  
**Impact if occurs**: High (6-12 month delay, $500K+ legal costs)

---

#### 2. Data Accuracy Risk

**Risk**: AI makes wrong predictions, users lose money, reputation damaged

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Historical accuracy tracking (87% on A-grade signals)
- ✅ Risk ratings on every observation (low/medium/high)
- ✅ Multiple signal confirmation (don't act on 1 source)
- ✅ Disclaimer: "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results"
- ✅ Third-party audits (quarterly)
- ✅ User education: "This is ONE input, not the only input"

**Probability**: Medium (40% chance of occasional misses)  
**Impact if occurs**: Medium (churn spike, brand damage, recoverable)

---

#### 3. Competition Risk

**Risk**: Bloomberg, Robinhood, or new entrant copies Brief

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ 7 defensive moats (data, AI, location, community, brand, speed, regulatory)
- ✅ First-mover advantage (18-month head start)
- ✅ Network effects (community observations)
- ✅ Exclusive data partnerships (Planet Labs, SafeGraph)
- ✅ Ship fast (features every 2 weeks)

**Probability**: High (70% someone tries)  
**Impact if successful**: High (market share loss)  
**Our advantage**: $100M+ and 3-5 years to replicate our moats

---

#### 4. Market Downturn Risk

**Risk**: Bear market → users stop investing → churn spike

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Brief works in ALL markets (identifies shorts, cash opportunities)
- ✅ Portfolio alerts more valuable in volatile markets
- ✅ Low price point ($10-25/month) = not first to cut
- ✅ Free tier keeps users engaged even if not trading
- ✅ Alternative data useful regardless of market direction

**Probability**: Medium (50% chance of bear market in next 5 years)  
**Impact**: Medium (temporary growth slowdown, churn increase to 8-10%)

---

#### 5. Technology Risk

**Risk**: Data pipeline breaks, briefings fail to deliver, downtime

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Redundant data sources (primary + backup for each)
- ✅ Auto-failover (30 seconds to switch sources)
- ✅ 99.9% uptime SLA (3 nines)
- ✅ Monitoring: Datadog, PagerDuty, 24/7 on-call
- ✅ Cloud-native (Kubernetes auto-healing)

**Probability**: Low (10% for major outage)  
**Impact**: Medium (reputational damage, user frustration, short-term)

---

#### 6. Alternative Data Cost Risk

**Risk**: Planet Labs raises prices from $10K to $50K/month, margins compressed

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Multi-year contracts (lock in pricing)
- ✅ Multiple providers (Planet + Maxar, can switch)
- ✅ Pass some cost to users (Premium tier price increase)
- ✅ Scale reduces per-user cost (50K users = $0.20/user/month)
- ✅ Build community contributions (user observations reduce reliance)

**Probability**: Medium (30% price increases)  
**Impact**: Low (margins drop from 87% to 82%, still excellent)

---

**Timeline**: Indefinite

**Strategy**:

- Generate $100M+ annual profit
- Dividend to investors (10-20% annual yield)
- Maintain control and independence
- Secondary liquidity every 2-3 years

**Investor Return**: 20-50x over 10 years (dividends + secondaries)

---

**Recent Fintech Exits**:

- Plaid → Visa: $5.3B (2020, acquisition canceled, now worth $13B)
- Credit Karma → Intuit: $7.1B (2020)
- Robinhood IPO: $32B (2021)
- Chime: $25B valuation (2021, private)
