## 🎯 Mission & Vision

### Our Mission

**To democratize financial intelligence by making institutional-grade market analysis accessible to every investor, regardless of wealth or location.**

We believe that access to quality financial information should not be a privilege reserved for the wealthy. By combining AI, alternative data, and location intelligence, we empower retail investors with the same insights that Wall Street professionals use—at a fraction of the cost.

### Our Vision

**To become the world's most trusted source of financial intelligence, serving 10 million investors across 100 cities by 2030.**

We envision a future where:
- Every investor starts their day with a personalized Brief at 6 AM
- Financial decisions are data-driven, not driven by fear or hype
- Local investors discover opportunities in their own communities
- Information asymmetry no longer gives institutions an unfair advantage
- Investment success is measured by accuracy, transparency, and user empowerment

## 🚀 What is Brief?

Brief is an **AI financial intelligence platform** that delivers **personalized investment briefings** every morning at 6 AM. We combine:

- 🤖 **AI Analysis** (GPT-4, FinBERT, LSTM models)
- 🛰️ **Alternative Data** (satellite imagery, foot traffic, credit card data)
- 📍 **Location Intelligence** (local opportunities in your city)
- 🔔 **Portfolio Alerts** (real-time opportunities for stocks you own)

**Result**: Institutional-grade market intelligence for $10-300/month (Bloomberg costs $24K/year).
